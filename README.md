2048 is a popular single-player sliding block puzzle game created by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli. The game is played on a 4Ã—4 grid with numbered tiles that can be slid around using the arrow keys or swipe gestures. The objective is to combine tiles with the same number to create a tile with the number 2048, hence the name of the game.
